# Phase 8 Plan 05: Live Apply + DoD Gates Summary (PARTIAL)

**Migration `0008_platform_health.sql` applied LIVE to Balkanity with operator sign-off — pg_cron + pg_net installed, `health_events` (admin-read RLS, no write policy, no PII) live, both cron schedules registered and firing; the shared cron secret provisioned in Vault + Vercel with the route auth chain proven (401/200). DoD Gates B (cron fires) and C (keep-alive + backstop) are GREEN and the money single-writer invariant holds live. Gate A (dropped-webhook reconciliation + critical email) is DEFERRED — the production deployment lacks the Stripe and Resend secrets it requires.**

## Performance
- **Duration:** ~25 min (includes Vercel redeploy + waiting one live `*/15` cron window)
- **Completed:** 2026-06-20
- **Tasks:** 3 (Task 1 sign-off ✓, Task 2 apply ✓, Task 3 gates — B/C ✓, A deferred)

## Accomplishments
- **Sign-off (Task 1):** operator approved the FLAGGED apply after an end-to-end DDL review (Balkanity-only ref, extensions-before-cron, no write policy, free-form `kind`, idempotent cron block).
- **Secret provisioning (Task 2):** generated a 64-hex secret (never printed); `vault.create_secret(...,'cron_secret')` on Balkanity + Vercel `CRON_SECRET` (server-only, production+preview+development) — same value; redeployed `balkanity_platform_project`.
- **DDL apply (Task 2):** full `0008` body POSTed to the Management API `/database/query` (response `[{"schedule":4}]`). Verified live: `pg_cron` 1.6.4 + `pg_net` 0.20.3; `health_events` with `rowsecurity=true`, columns with **no `transfer_id`**, single `health_events_admin_read` SELECT policy (**no write policy**), `health_events_open_idx` partial index; cron jobs `health-sweep` (`*/15`, active) + `digest-hourly` (`0 *`, active).
- **Route auth:** `POST /api/cron/health` → **401** without secret, **200 `{"ok":true}`** with the Vault secret — the Vault↔Vercel secret match + timing-safe gate proven.
- **Gate B (cron fires):** `cron.job_run_details` at `11:00:00Z` shows both jobs `succeeded`.
- **Gate C (keep-alive + backstop):** `keepalive` `health_events` rows recur (10:58 manual + 11:00 cron, `resolved_at` set so never alerting); backstop auth 200/401 confirmed.
- **No-paid-write invariant (live):** both live sweeps wrote **only** keepalive rows — zero `paid` writes, zero `wp_transfers` status changes; `single-writer.test.ts` GREEN.

## Files Created/Modified
- `.planning/phases/08-platform-health/08-GATES-EVIDENCE.md` — full runbook + gate evidence (status: partial).

## Deviations from Plan
- **Two redeploys fired** (an accidental duplicate redeploy request) — harmless; the latest READY deployment became production.
- **Gate A deferred** (not a code deviation): the plan assumed prod had the Stripe + Resend secrets; it does not. Documented as a blocker with explicit close-out steps in `08-GATES-EVIDENCE.md`.

## Issues Encountered / Blockers
- **Production env gap:** `balkanity_platform_project` env = `CRON_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Missing `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`. The latter two are unavailable locally as well; `send.balkanity.com` is unverified (open Phase-7 D-15 gate). Gate A's reconciliation-detection + critical-email + webhook-replay legs cannot run until the operator provisions these.

## Threat Flags
- T-08-17 (wrong project): mitigated — ref guardrail re-asserted before DDL; Kalvia absent.
- T-08-18 (secret in cron.command): mitigated — secret read from Vault `decrypted_secrets`, not inlined.
- T-08-19 (sweep sets paid): mitigated + proven live — sweeps wrote zero paid; single-writer test green.
- T-08-20 (secret mismatch → silent 401): mitigated — 200/401 probe confirms the match.

## User Setup Required (to close Gate A + the phase)
1. Decide Stripe pilot mode (test vs live); set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` server-only on `balkanity_platform_project`; redeploy.
2. Verify Resend `send.balkanity.com` (DNS) + set `RESEND_API_KEY` server-only; this also closes the Phase-7 D-15 gate.
3. Run Gate A: seed a paid Stripe session whose transfer stays `requested` → sweep → assert reconciliation row + admin in-app + critical email + transfer NOT paid → idempotent webhook replay remediates → no re-alert; clean up the seeded row.

## Gate A — PASSED (live, added 2026-06-20)
After the operator provisioned `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`/`RESEND_API_KEY` on Vercel prod, Gate A was proven end-to-end with a real paid Stripe test session: the live sweep detected the dropped-webhook discrepancy (`health_events` row + both admins notified in-app) and wrote **no `paid`**; a signature-verified webhook replay idempotently flipped `paid` (duplicate replay deduped, forged signature 400'd); a second sweep did not re-alert. All seeded data deleted (zero residue, non-keepalive `health_events` = 0). One caveat: the critical email *fires* (`tier=critical`) but `outcome=failed` pending `send.balkanity.com` verification in Resend (shared Phase-7 D-15 DNS item). Full evidence in `08-GATES-EVIDENCE.md`.

## Self-Check: PASSED
Migration 0008 verified live (extensions + table + RLS + cron jobs); secret chain proven (401/200); all three DoD gates (A/B/C) GREEN live; no-paid-write invariant proven live; `08-GATES-EVIDENCE.md` written. Only the critical-email *delivery* leg is pending Resend domain verification — the DoD (reconciliation catches the dropped webhook without setting paid) is met.
